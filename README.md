## Testing the REST-api

### Blackboard

Ask for blackbord service with netcat.
```
netcat -ulvp 24000
```
We receive somthing like:
```
listening on [any] 24000 ...
connect to [172.19.0.14] from blackboard.pdui_container [172.19.0.7] 48172
{"blackboard_port":5000}
```

### Adventurer

Look into the already existing data to get some examples:

```
curl -X POST abw286:1234@172.19.0.7:5000/taverna/adventurers
```
One example:
```json
...,
{
      "capabilities": "bully", 
      "heroclass": "metal", 
      "url": "172.19.0.36", 
      "user": "/users/Ritter"
},
...
```

Create new adventurer with:
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST abw286:1234@172.19.0.7:5000/taverna/adventurers -d '{ "heroclass": "bastard", "capabilities": "", "url": "172.19.0.14/users/Bastard" }'
```
answer:
```
{
  "message": "Created Adventurer", 
  "object": [
    {
      "capabilities": "", 
      "heroclass": "bastard", 
      "url": "172.19.0.14/users/Bastard", 
      "user": "/users/abw286"
    }
  ], 
  "status": "success"
}
```
